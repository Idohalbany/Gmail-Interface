# Gmail Clone

This project is a clone of the intuitive interface of Gmail, built to replicate the familiar user experience and layout of Google's widely-used email service. The application is developed using React for building the components, Redux for managing the state, and Styled Components for the styling of the application.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: A clean and user-friendly interface similar to Gmail.
- **React Framework**: Utilizes the React library for efficient UI component creation.
- **Redux for State Management**: Manages the application's state with Redux for predictable outcomes.
- **Styled Components**: Implements Styled Components for scoped CSS styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices for accessibility.
